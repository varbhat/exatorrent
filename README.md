## Introduction
exatorrent is [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.org/) Client written in [Go](https://go.dev/). 
It can be run locally or be hosted in Remote Server with good resources 
to use that Server as [SeedBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox). 
It is Single Completely Statically Linked Binary with Zero External Dependencies .

exatorrent is simple yet feature-rich . It is 
lightweight and light on resources. It comes with Beautiful Responsive Web Client written in Svelte and Typescript , 
but thanks to documented [WebSocket](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) [API](docs/API.md) of exatorrent , you can also write your own client if you want to.

exatorrent can operate in Optional Multi-User Mode administrated by admin user/s 
but it can successfully be used by Single-User as well. 
Torrented Files are stored in local disk of device where it's run, which are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP.
